# SQLY
SQLY is a very simple project that aims to provide a single file script to gather basic statistics and correlation of data in MySQL Databases.
On the basis of given user inputs,it can gather mainly 2 things:
1. **Basic Statistics**: Mean,Median,Mode,SD,Skewness/Kurtosis and Quartile Deviation
2. **Correlation**: Correlation between chosen attributes of the relation <br>

Click on "**Submit**" after applying those tools to add it to your report. At the end click on "**Generate Report**", which will generate an html file containing your report items.
